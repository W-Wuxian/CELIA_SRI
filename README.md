Description of the CELIA team and SRI sector.

## CEntre Lasers Intenses et Applications (CELIA)
CELIA iss a mixed research unit (UMR5107) founded in 1999 by the University of Bordeaux and the CNRS, joined in 2003 by the CEA (Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives).
CELIA was created following the decision to install the Mégajoule laser in Aquitaine. Its main missions are to:
- develop intense laser themes
- interaction in extreme regimes with matter
- build large laser infrastures like LMJ/PETAL
CELIA is looking forward to solve societal objectives like nuclear, medical and astrophysic domains.

## Laser MégaJoule LMJ / PETAL
LMJ (2014) system can be resume to 3 parts:
- Amplification lines
 + Creation and amplification of 176 laser beams
- Beams transportation
- Experiment Chamber
PETawatt Aquitaine Laser (2017) is a laser pulse of one picosecond, or a thousand times shorter than that of the LMJ.

## TEAMS
CELIA is composed by 5 teams:
- GOLF Femtosecond lasers (10^-15)
- HXUV Laser-matter interaction modeling
- IFCIA Numerical simulations of laser absorption process
- PETRUX Hot plasma physics, superheated matter
- SLAM Laser-matter interaction with short-pulse lasers

## Service Ressources Informatiques (SRI)
SRI is a team from Bordeaux University helping CELIA around two axes:
- Administration, management and operation of systems and networks
- Development, calculation and research support
  + Adding CI/CD, auto-test non-regression unit-test, benchmarking
  + Code Optimization using SIMD, memory management/layout, compilation flags
  + Code accelerator OpenMPI, MPI, GPU
  + Numerical experimentations on computation nodes like OCCIGEN
  + ...
